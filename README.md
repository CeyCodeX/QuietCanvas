## ✨ About This Project

**QuietCanvas** was started to create a **[Describe the core function again, briefly. E.g., simple, distraction-free web application]** for the meditation community. We believe that well-built, accessible tools should be available to everyone, which is why this is entirely **open source** and driven by community contribution.

Our goals are:
* To provide a **reliable, clean, and focused** meditation experience that serves as a 'blank canvas' for your practice.
* To foster an **inclusive and welcoming** development community.
* To prioritize **user privacy** (no tracking or mandatory accounts).
